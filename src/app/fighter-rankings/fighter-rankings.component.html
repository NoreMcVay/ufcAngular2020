        <h1>UFC Fighter Rankings</h1>
        <p>Ultimate Fighting Championship rankings, which were introduced in February 2013, are generated by a voting panel made up of media members. The media members are asked to vote for who they feel are the top fighters in the UFC by weight class and pound-for-pound. A fighter is only eligible to be voted on if they are in active status in the UFC. A fighter can appear in more than one weight division at a time. The champion and interim champion are considered to be in the top positions of their respective divisions and therefore are not eligible for voting by weight class. However, the champions can be voted on for the pound-for-pound rankings.</p>
